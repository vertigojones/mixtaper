Mixtaper is an app that brings back the lost art of creating a mixtape. Before playlists were invented, people would create mixtapes and compile their favorite songs together onto a single tape cassette. Sometimes those compilations would be personal, sometimes they were written for someone else (like a loved one). There were mixtapes created for special occasions, particular genres or artists, workouts, or just to listen to while driving to work. If you were writing a mix for a friend, it could be a way to emotionally connect with them and share your innermost feelings, in a way that you cannot personally put into words.

Whatever your reason was behind your mixtape, we’re bringing it all back, but with a modern twist. Now you can exchange messages and comments along with your favorite mixes! You are free to share your mixtapes with all of your friends, and even send one anonymously to someone you admire … but there is a catch. Just like with a cassette tape, you are limited to what you can create. Instead of being limited with time, on Mixtaper you are limited to songs - 16 to be exact. So, you need to put some thought into what songs make it onto each mixtape, just like back in the day.
